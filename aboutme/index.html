  <h2>Gabriel Boff</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! My name is Gabriel Boff, I love programming, I'm single and
    I rised in the Church since I was born. I have 4 years of expirience
    as a Software Engineer, I’m looking to grow up my career and increase my skills.
    I’m currently looking for a job. I started studying development since I was 14 years old.
    I learned to be patient and share the knowledge that I have with others.
    Also, from logic, insights, and pragmatism, I know that I am creating something new using
    these skills that I mentioned. During my career I experienced a lot of
    opportunities to learn, working for startups and great companies,
    because of this situation I started a degree at BYU-Idaho.
